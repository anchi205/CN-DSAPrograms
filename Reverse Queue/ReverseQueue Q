You have been given a queue that can store integers as the data. 
You are required to write a function that reverses the populated queue itself without using any other data structures.

Input Format:
The first list of input contains an integer 't' denoting the number of test cases/queries to be run.
Then the test cases follow.
The first line input for each test case/query contains an integer N, denoting the total number of elements in the queue.
The second line of input contains N integers separated by a single space, representing the order in which the elements are enqueued into the queue.

Output Format:
For each test case/query, the only line of output prints the order in which the queue elements are dequeued, all of them separated by a single space.

Output for every test case/query will be printed on a new line. 

Sample Input 1:
1
6
1 2 3 4 5 10
Note:
Here, 1 is at the front and 10 is at the rear of the queue.
Sample Output 1:
10 5 4 3 2 1
Sample Input 2:
2
5
2 8 15 1 10
3
10 20 30
Sample Output 2:
10 1 15 8 2 
30 20 10
